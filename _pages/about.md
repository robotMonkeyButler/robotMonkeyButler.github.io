I am currently a junior undergraduate student at ShanghaiTech University and an exchange student at UIUC, majoring in computer science. I am very fortunate to join the UIUC U Lab advised by <a href='https://cs.stanford.edu/~jiaxuan/'>Prof. Jiaxuan You</a> and mentor <a href='https://haofeiyu.me/'>Mr. Haofei Yu</a>.

Previously, I worked under the guidance of <a href='https://angelicaiaviles.wordpress.com/'> Prof. Angelica Aviles-Rivero </a> at Cambridge University and Tsinghua University YMSC. I acted as an undergraduate research assistant in <a href='https://xiong-group.com/'> WiSe Lab</a> advised by <a href='https://xiong-group.com/people/'>Prof. Ze Xiong</a> from Sept. 2023 to Sept. 2024. I also interned at Shanghai AI Laboratory, focusing on large language models application.
